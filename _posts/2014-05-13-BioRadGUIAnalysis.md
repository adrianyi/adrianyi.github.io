# GUI Analysis Program on MATLAB

This is a GUI analysis program I designed and created on MATLAB that decreased the analysis time by factor of ~x50 (compared to manual analysis on a spectroscopy analysis software GRAMS).  The software loads a data file in a CSV format, and allows quick pre-analysis adjustment and full analysis through a responsive plot.  After analysis, it saves all relevant post-analysis spectra.

I will post a gif of a normal use soon! (As of 2017/07/17)
